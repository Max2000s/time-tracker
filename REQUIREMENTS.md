# Requirements Document for Task Time Tracker CLI Tool

## 1. Overview
The Task Time Tracker CLI tool is designed to help users track the time spent on various tasks. Users can start, stop, and continue tasks, as well as take breaks. The tool will record the time spent on each task and provide summary reports.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Basic Features
1. **Start Task**:
   - Command: `start <task_name>`
   - Description: Start a new task timer with the specified task name. If the task already exists, it should continue from where it left off.
   
2. **Stop Task**:
   - Command: `stop`
   - Description: Stop the current task timer and save the elapsed time.

3. **Continue Task**:
   - Command: `continue <task_name>`
   - Description: Continue a previously stopped task.

4. **Take Break**:
   - Command: `break <break_name>`
   - Description: Start a break timer. Breaks can be categorized (e.g., lunch, meeting).

5. **End Break**:
   - Command: `end_break`
   - Description: End the current break and resume the previous task if applicable.

### 2.2 Additional Features
1. **List Tasks**:
   - Command: `list`
   - Description: List all tracked tasks with their total accumulated times.

2. **Task Summary**:
   - Command: `summary <task_name>`
   - Description: Show the total time spent on the specified task.

3. **Overall Summary**:
   - Command: `summary`
   - Description: Show the total time spent on all tasks and breaks.

4. **Export Data**:
   - Command: `export <format>`
   - Description: Export the tracked data to a file in the specified format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

5. **Import Data**:
   - Command: `import <file_path>`
   - Description: Import previously exported data into the tool.

6. **Configure Settings**:
   - Command: `config <setting> <value>`
   - Description: Configure tool settings such as default break types, time formats, etc.

7. **Filter Tasks by Time Period**:
   - Command: `filter <period>`
   - Description: Filter tasks by specified period (day, week, month).
   - Examples: `filter day`, `filter week`, `filter month`

### 2.3 Error Handling
- Handle invalid commands gracefully.
- Ensure task names are unique or provide an option to handle duplicates.
- Provide meaningful error messages and usage instructions.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- The tool should be lightweight and have minimal startup time.
- Efficiently handle time calculations and data storage.

### 3.2 Usability
- Provide clear and concise command-line help (`--help` or `-h`).
- Ensure commands are intuitive and easy to remember.

### 3.3 Portability
- The tool should work on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### 3.4 Data Persistence
- Store task data in a local database or file.
- Ensure data integrity and prevent corruption.

## 4. Language Considerations
**Rust** will be used for this project. Rust offers strong safety guarantees, high performance, and excellent concurrency support, making it a suitable choice for building a robust CLI tool.

## 5. Persistence Details
For data persistence, you can use a local database or file system to store task data. Hereâ€™s a more detailed approach:

### 5.1 Data Storage Format
- **File-based Storage**: Use JSON or CSV files to store task data. This approach is simple and suitable for smaller datasets.
- **Embedded Database**: Use SQLite for more complex data handling, allowing for efficient queries and better scalability.

### 5.2 Data Structure
- **Task Data Model**:
  ```rust
  struct Task {
      id: u32,
      name: String,
      start_time: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
      accumulated_time: Duration,
      history: Vec<TimeEntry>,
  }

  struct TimeEntry {
      start: DateTime<Utc>,
      end: DateTime<Utc>,
  }
  ```

### 5.3 Operations
1. **Start Task**:
   - Check if the task exists. If it does, update the `start_time`.
   - If the task does not exist, create a new entry in the data storage.

2. **Stop Task**:
   - Calculate the elapsed time since `start_time`.
   - Update the `accumulated_time` and add a new `TimeEntry` to the `history`.

3. **Continue Task**:
   - Retrieve the task and update the `start_time`.

4. **Take Break / End Break**:
   - Similar to stopping and starting tasks, handle break periods.

5. **List Tasks**:
   - Retrieve and display all tasks with their accumulated times.

6. **Filter Tasks**:
   - Implement functions to filter tasks based on the specified time period (day, week, month).

7. **Export / Import Data**:
   - Serialize and deserialize the data to/from JSON or CSV files.

### 5.4 Example Commands
- Start a task: `task-tracker start coding`
- Stop the current task: `task-tracker stop`
- Continue a task: `task-tracker continue coding`
- Take a break: `task-tracker break lunch`
- End a break: `task-tracker end_break`
- List all tasks: `task-tracker list`
- Task summary: `task-tracker summary coding`
- Overall summary: `task-tracker summary`
- Export data: `task-tracker export csv`
- Import data: `task-tracker import data.json`
- Filter tasks: `task-tracker filter day`
